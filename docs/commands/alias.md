# `codex-auth alias`

## Usage

```shell
codex-auth alias set <query> <alias>
codex-auth alias clear <query>
```

## Selector Rules

`<query>` resolves from stored local data only. It does not trigger API refresh.

Selectors can match:

- displayed row number,
- alias fragment,
- email fragment, or
- account name fragment.

If one account matches, the command updates that account immediately. If multiple accounts match, the command falls back to interactive selection in a TTY.

## Set Alias

`codex-auth alias set <query> <alias>` stores an alias in `registry.json` for the matched account.

- Empty aliases are rejected.
- All-digit aliases are rejected because numeric selectors already refer to displayed row numbers.
- Alias comparison is case-insensitive for duplicate detection.
- Changing an alias updates only stored registry metadata.

## Clear Alias

`codex-auth alias clear <query>` removes the stored alias for the matched account.

If the alias is already empty, the command reports that state and leaves the registry unchanged.

Status messages and errors mask account emails, including emails embedded in aliases.
Stored aliases and email selectors keep their original values.
