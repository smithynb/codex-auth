# Test Organization

This project keeps production modules behind normal module boundaries, while test files are compiled as separate test roots from `build.zig`.

## Goals

- Keep production code free of inline `test` blocks.
- Keep test-only fixtures outside `src/`.
- Run each test file as an independent Zig test artifact.
- Preserve the exact test descriptions from `main` when refactoring behavior.
- Prefer public behavior-oriented module boundaries over test-only access shims.

## Directory Layout

```text
src/
  root.zig              # public package surface
  ...                   # production modules only

tests/
  *_test.zig            # behavior and regression tests
  support/
    fixtures.zig        # test-only builders and file helpers
```

Test files should be grouped by product area or workflow, not by implementation detail. Use names such as `api_http_test.zig`, `registry_import_test.zig`, `tui_table_test.zig`, or `workflows_live_test.zig`.

## Build Integration

`build.zig` owns the test suite with an explicit `test_files` array. For each entry, it creates a separate `b.addTest` artifact and injects the `codex_auth` package import.

This keeps failures localized to the test file that owns them and avoids a large aggregate `tests/root.zig` importing everything manually.

A small library compile test may be included to validate the package surface with `std.testing.refAllDecls`.

## Production/Test Boundary

Production modules must not import `tests/` or `tests/support/`.

Avoid `test_api` or other test-only public namespaces in `src/`. If a rule is important enough to test directly, prefer one of these options:

1. Test it through a public behavior or workflow.
2. Extract it into a focused production module with a normal public API.
3. Make the helper public only when it is a stable, useful module boundary.

Private implementation details that are not stable behavior should not be tested directly.

## Launcher and terminal regressions

The personal fork also has offline Node and Python regressions for poke eligibility,
email masking, daemon restart prompts, help output, and terminal layout. Run them
after installing the local binary:

```sh
zig build
node --test tests/personal_poke_test.mjs
python3 tests/personal_restart_test.py
python3 tests/personal_help_test.py
python3 tests/list_terminal_test.py
```

These tests use temporary account fixtures and fake executables. They do not need
real credentials or provider requests. The Python terminal tests require POSIX
pseudoterminals, so CI runs this group on Ubuntu alongside the Zig platform matrix.

## Fixtures

Fixtures belong under `tests/support/`. Import them with a relative path from tests:

```zig
const fixtures = @import("support/fixtures.zig");
```

Do not expose fixtures from `src/root.zig`.

## Test Descriptions

When refactoring, test descriptions must remain compatible with `main`. This is part of the compatibility contract. A refactor is acceptable only when the set of test descriptions remains unchanged unless the behavior itself intentionally changes.

## Validation Checklist

After changing `.zig` files, run these from an isolated `/tmp/<task-name>` directory with isolated `HOME` and `CODEX_HOME`:

```sh
zig fmt $(find /path/to/repo -name '*.zig' -type f | sort)
zig build --build-file /path/to/repo/build.zig --cache-dir /tmp/<task-name>/cache test
zig build --build-file /path/to/repo/build.zig --cache-dir /tmp/<task-name>/cache run -- list
git diff --check
```

Also verify:

```sh
rg '^test "' src
rg 'test_api|src/testing|testing\.fixtures' src tests
```

The first command should return no source inline tests. The second command should return no `test_api` or production fixture exports.
